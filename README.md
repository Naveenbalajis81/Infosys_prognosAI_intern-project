# 🔧 PrognosAI: AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance System Using Time-Series Sensor Data

## 🎯 Project Objective

Design and develop an AI-based predictive maintenance system to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of industrial machinery using multivariate time-series sensor data. This prototype uses the NASA CMAPSS dataset and is adaptable across domains like turbines, pumps, and motors. The goal is to enable timely maintenance decisions, minimize unplanned downtime, and optimize asset utilization with deep learning models such as LSTM for sequential pattern recognition and failure prediction.

## 🗂️ Project Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Load and preprocess the CMAPSS sensor dataset (cycle-wise engine data).

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create rolling window sequences and compute Remaining Useful Life (RUL) targets.

3. **Model Training**  
   - Train a time-series model (e.g., LSTM or GRU) to predict RUL from sensor sequences.

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate model performance using RMSE and compare predicted RUL vs actual RUL.

5. **Risk Thresholding**  
   - Define thresholds to trigger maintenance alerts based on predicted RUL.

6. **Visualization & Output**  
   - Present results through charts and dashboards showing RUL trends and alert zones.
